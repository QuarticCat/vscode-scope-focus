# Scope Focus

When you work on a large repo, most of the time you only need to focus on a subset of files. This extension enables you to switch between predefined subsets (called "scopes") and hides rest files. It aims to provide a similar experience to IntelliJ's [scopes](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-scopes.html) feature.

You can consider it as a workaround of [vscode#869](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/869).
